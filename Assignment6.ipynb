    "Question 1:\n",
    "Define Object Oriented Programming Language?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "It's that type of Programming technique in which programmers self defines data type of data structure along with the operations to be held. In this way, the data structure becomes an object that includes both data and functions."

    "Answer:\n",
    "1. Inheritence Property is that property which makes programming lot easier as we can use the parameters of different objects on other object without rewriting the whole code.\n",
    "2. Reusable objects which makes programming faster\n",
    "3. It provides a clear modular structure for programs.\n",

    "4. Behavior\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "1. Class:\n",
    "Class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure).\n",
    "2. Object:\n",
    "An object is nothing but a self-contained component which consists of methods and properties to make a particular type of data useful. Object determines the behavior of the class. When you send a message to an object, you are asking the object to invoke or execute one of its methods.\n",
    "3. Attribute:\n",
